	abstract = {This chapter discusses drying, conditioning, and industrial space heating. Drying is most commonly the removal of moderate quantities of liquid from a solid by thermal means. Where practicable, this is preceded by mechanical methods of moisture removal that have a lower energy requirement. Special cases of drying are evaporation, dehydration, and freeze-drying. The following are the main purposes of drying: (1) to reduce bulk or weight for economic further processing, handling, or transport; (2) to produce the material in the desired condition for further processing, handling, or marketing; (3) to sterilize or preserve the product; and (4) to recover by-products from slurries or solutions. In a drying operation, heat must be supplied to raise the temperature of the incoming air, warm up the material being handled, heat up and evaporate the water in the incoming material, and compensate for heat losses from the structure, for example, by convection, radiation, and air leakage.},

	abstract = {Dry-processing environments are particularly challenging to clean and sanitize because water introduced into systems not designed for wet cleaning can favor growth and establishment of pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella. The objective was to determine the efficacy of isopropyl alcohol quaternary ammonium ({IPAQuat}) formula and carbon dioxide ({CO}2) sanitizer system for eliminating Enterococcus faecium and Salmonella on food contact surfaces. Coupons of stainless steel and conveyor belting material used in dry-processing environments were spot-inoculated in the center of 5 × 5 cm coupons with approximately 7.0 log {CFU}/ml of E. faecium and up to 10 log {CFU}/ml of a six-serotype composite of Salmonella and subjected to {IPAQuat}-{CO}2 sanitation treatments using exposure times of 30 s, 1 or 5 min. After sanitation treatments, wet coupons were swabbed for post-treatment survivors. Preliminary experiments included coupons which were soiled with a flour and water solution prior to inoculation and subsequent sanitation treatments. For the main study, inoculated surfaces were soiled with a breadcrumb flour blend and allowed to sit on the lab bench for a minimum of 16 h before sanitation. Preliminary results showed that {IPAQuat}-{CO}2 sanitizing system was effective in reducing approximately 3.0 logs of E. faecium and Salmonella from clean and soiled surfaces after 1 min exposure but higher initial inoculum levels were needed to demonstrate \&gt;5 log reductions. For the main study, pre-treatment Salmonella populations were approximately 7.0 log {CFU}/25 cm and post-treatment survivors were 1.3, \&lt; 0.7 (detection limit), and \&lt; 0.7 log {CFU}/25 cm after 30 s, 1 or 5 min sanitizer exposures, respectively, for both clean and soiled surfaces. Treatment with {IPAQuat}-{CO}2 sanitation system using 30 s sanitizer exposures resulted in 5.7 log {CFU}/25 cm reductions whereas, greater than 6.0 log {CFU}/25 cm reductions were observed for sanitizer exposures of 1 and 5 min. The {IPAQuat}-{CO}2 sanitation system reduced 6 logs {CFU}/25 cm of Salmonella with sanitizer exposure times of at least 1 min. The {IPAQuatCO}2 system would, therefore, be an effective sanitation system to eliminate potential contamination from Salmonella on food contact surfaces and have application in facilities that process dry ingredients or low-moisture products.},

	abstract = {A new facile approach for preparing two nonfluorinated hybrid organic–inorganic siloxane/polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposite coatings for cotton fabrics is presented using two distinct silylating agents. The first coated fabric was prepared predominantly via trimethylsilyl modification using hexamethyldisilazane ({HMDS}) while higher amounts of trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane ({TMOS}) further enhanced the superhydrophobicity of the second coating matrix. Unlike {HMDS} with substituted silyl (Me3Si) groups, {TMOS} consists of hydrolysable trimethoxy silyl (({MeO})3Si) chemical groups that allowed for the formation of nanosilica with Si–O–Si linkages needed to foster stable coatings. After characterization and testing, these coated fabrics demonstrated varying responses to harsh solvents and thermal conditions. Both sets of coated fabrics exhibited unique capacities for self-cleaning and oil–water separation as superhydrophobic filters due to (a) their low surface energy silylated hybrid polysiloxane chemical groups, (b) their highly reduced surface wettability and (c) nanopatterned surface morphologies. In this study, coated superhydrophobic cotton fabrics revealed a higher static aqueous contact angle of more than 150° and sliding hysteresis angle of less than 5°. Coated fabrics with 30 mg {TMOS}/10 mg {HMDS} ({CMF}3) and 30 mg {HMDS}/10 mg {TMOS} ({CTF}3) exhibited optimal superhydrophobicity. Both fabrics also retained percentage separation efficiencies over 90\% for both chloroform–water and toluene–water mixtures. However, {CTF}3 displayed with a recorded separation efficiency less than 90° after five filtration cycles.},
